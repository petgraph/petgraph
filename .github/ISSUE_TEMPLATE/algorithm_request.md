<!--
  -- Thanks for filing a `petgraph` issue! Please fill out the template
  -- below. We appreciate it :)
  -->

### What algorithm are you requesting to be added?

A description of the algorithm to be added. Try to answer the following questions:

- What (graph) problem does it solve?
- What is the basic idea of the algorithm?

### Please provide resources like a wikipedia page or a paper where the algorithm is explained. Preferably provide a reference implementation. E.g. from NetworkX.

A wikipedia link is sufficient, if a page exists. Otherwise please provide a paper or other material on the details of the algorithm.
Preferably also look for reference implementations that contributors could base an implementation off of. 

### Are you willing to implement this yourself? Mentor someone else and help them implement it?



### Does petgraph already offer alternative algorithms that solve the problem, and if so, why is this new algorithm still useful?

Please make sure to check petgraph or pose a question if you are unsure whether petgraph already offers similar functionality. If so, describe here, why the new algorithm is still useful and for which use cases.

### Additional context

Any other information you would like to add such as related previous issues / work.
