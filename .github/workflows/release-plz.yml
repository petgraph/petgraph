  # Create a PR with the new versions and changelog, preparing the next release.

  # Note: When using the default `secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN` provided by GitHub Actions, the created PR
  # will not trigger CI checks due to a limitation on recursive workflows.
  # We could use a personal access token (PAT) instead, but we should create a bot account for that
  # (otherwise PRs will be created in whoever's account provided the token).
