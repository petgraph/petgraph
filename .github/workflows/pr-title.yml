            It looks like your proposed title indicates a breaking change. If that's the case, please make sure to include a "BREAKING CHANGE:" footer in the body of the pull request describing the breaking change and any migration instructions.

            We require pull request titles to follow the [Conventional Commits specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) and it looks like your proposed title needs to be adjusted.

            Your title should look like this. The scope field is optional.
            ```
            <type>(<scope>): <description>
            ```

            If the PR includes a breaking change, mark it with an exclamation mark:
            ```
            <type>!: <description>
            ```
            and include a "BREAKING CHANGE:" footer in the body of the pull request.

            Available types:
            - feat: A new feature
            - fix: A bug fix
            - docs: Documentation only changes
            - refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
            - perf: A code change that improves performance
            - test: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
            - ci: Changes to the CI configuration files and scripts
            - chore: Other changes that don't affect the published crate
            - revert: Reverts a previous commit
