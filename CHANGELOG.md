## [0.5.1] - 2020-05-23

- Implement `Default` for traversals.
- Export `EdgesConnecting` publicly.
- Implement `is_bipartite_graph`.
- Add `FilterNode` implementation for `FixedBitSet` and `HashSet`.
- Implement `node_weights_mut` and `edge_weights_mut` for
  `StableGraph`.
- Add configurable functions for adding attributes to dotfile
  features.

## [0.5.0] - 2019-12-25

### Breaking changes

- The iterative DFS implementation, `Dfs`, now marks nodes visited
  when they are pushed onto the stack, not when they\'re popped off.
  This may require changes to callers that use `Dfs::from_parts` or
  manipulate its internals.
- The `IntoEdgesDirected` trait now has a stricter contract for
  undirected graphs. Custom implementations of this trait may have to
  be updated. See the [trait
  documentation](https://docs.rs/petgraph/0.5/petgraph/visit/trait.IntoEdgesDirected.html)
  for more.

### Other changes

- Fix `bellman_ford` to work correctly with undirected graphs (#152)
  by \@carrutstick
- Performance improvements for `Graph, Stablegraph`\'s `.map()`.

## [0.4.8] - 2017-09-20

- `StableGraph` learned new methods nearing parity with `Graph`. Note
  that the `StableGraph` methods preserve index stability even in the
  batch removal methods like `filter_map` and `retain_edges`.
    - Added `.filter_map()`, which maps associated node and edge data
    - Added `.retain_edges()`, `.edge_indices()` and `.clear_edges()`
- Existing `Graph` iterators gained some trait impls:
    - `.node_indices(), .edge_indices()` are `ExactSizeIterator`
    - `.node_references()` is now
      `DoubleEndedIterator + ExactSizeIterator`.
    - `.edge_references()` is now `ExactSizeIterator`.
- Implemented `From<StableGraph>` for `Graph`.

## [0.4.7] - 2017-09-16

- New algorithm by \@jmcomets: A\* search algorithm in
  `petgraph::algo::astar`
- One `StableGraph` bug fix whose patch was supposed to be in the
  previous version:
    - `add_edge(m, n, _)` now properly always panics if nodes m or n
      don\'t exist in the graph.

## [0.4.6] - 2017-09-12

- New optional crate feature: `"serde-1"`, which enables serialization
  for `Graph` and `StableGraph` using serde.

- Add indexing with `[]` by node index, `NodeCompactIndexable` for
  `Csr` by \@jmcomets

  panic)
- Add implementation of `From<Graph>` for `StableGraph`.
- Add implementation of `IntoNodeReferences` for `&StableGraph`.
- Add method `StableGraph::map` that maps associated data
- Add method `StableGraph::find_edge_undirected`
- Many `StableGraph` bug fixes involving node vacancies (holes left by
  deletions):
    - `neighbors(n)` and similar neighbor and edge iterator methods
      now handle n being a vacancy properly. (This produces an empty
      iterator.)
    - `find_edge(m, n)` now handles m being a vacancy correctly too
    - `StableGraph::node_bound` was fixed for empty graphs and returns
      0
- Add implementation of `DoubleEndedIterator` to
  `Graph, StableGraph`\'s edge references iterators.
- Debug output for `Graph` now shows node and edge count.
  `Graph, StableGraph` show nothing for the edges list if it\'s empty
  (no label).

  with vacancies (used by quickcheck)

  (#153)

## [0.4.2] - 2017-01-06

- Move the `visit.rs` file due to changed rules for a module's
  directory ownership in Rust, resolving a future compat warning.
- The error types `Cycle, NegativeCycle` now implement `PartialEq`.

## [0.4.1] - 2016-10-26

- Add new algorithm `simple_fast` for computing dominators in a
  control-flow graph.

## [0.4.0] - 2016-10-17

### Breaking changes in `Graph`

- `Graph::edges` and the other edges methods now return an iterator of
  edge references

### Other breaking changes

- `toposort` now returns an error if the graph had a cycle.
- `is_cyclic_directed` no longer takes a dfs space argument. It is now
  recursive.
- `scc` was renamed to `kosaraju_scc`.
- `min_spanning_tree` now returns an iterator that needs to be made
  into a specific graph type deliberately.
- `dijkstra` now uses the `IntoEdges` trait.
- `NodeIndexable` changed its method signatures.
- `IntoExternals` was removed, and many other smaller adjustments in
  graph traits. `NodeId` must now implement `PartialEq`, for example.
- `DfsIter, BfsIter` were removed in favour of a more general approach
  with the `Walker` trait and its iterator conversion.

### New features

- New graph traits, for example `IntoEdges` which returns an iterator
  of edge references. Everything implements the graph traits much more
  consistently.
- Traits for associated data access and building graphs: `DataMap`,
  `Build, Create, FromElements`.
- Graph adaptors: `EdgeFiltered`. `Filtered` was renamed to
  `NodeFiltered`.
- New algorithms: bellman-ford
- New graph: compressed sparse row (`Csr`).
- `GraphMap` implements `NodeIndexable`.
- `Dot` was generalized

## [0.3.2] - 2016-10-11

> - Add `depth_first_search`, a recursive dfs visitor that emits
    > discovery, finishing and edge classification events.
> - Add graph adaptor `Filtered`.
> - impl `Debug, NodeIndexable` for `Reversed`.

## [0.3.1] - 2016-10-05

- Add `.edges(), .edges_directed()` to `StableGraph`. Note that these
  differ from `Graph`, because this is the signature they will all use
  in the future.
- Add `.update_edge()` to `StableGraph`.
- Add reexports of common items in `stable_graph` module (for example
  `NodeIndex`).
- Minor performance improvements to graph iteration
- Improved docs for `visit` module.

## [0.3.0] - 2016-10-03

- Overhaul all graph visitor traits so that they use the
  `IntoIterator` style. This makes them composable.
    - Multiple graph algorithms use new visitor traits.
    - **Help is welcome to port more algorithms (and create new graph
      traits in the process)!**
- `GraphMap` can now have directed edges. `GraphMap::new` is now
  generic in the edge type. `DiGraphMap` and `UnGraphMap` are new type
  aliases.
- Add type aliases `DiGraph, UnGraph, StableDiGraph, StableUnGraph`
- `GraphMap` is based on the indexmap crate. Deterministic iteration
  order, faster iteration, no side tables needed to convert to
  `Graph`.

- Add graph visitor `DfsPostOrder`
- `Dfs` gained new methods `from_parts` and `reset`.
- New algo `has_path_connecting`.

- Optional graph visitor workspace reuse in `has_path_connecting`,
  `is_cyclic_directed, toposort`.
- Improved `Debug` formatting for `Graph, StableGraph`.
- Add a prelude module
- `GraphMap` now has a method `.into_graph()` that makes a `Graph`.
- `Graph::retain_nodes, retain_edges` now expose the self graph only
  as wrapped in `Frozen`, so that weights can be mutated but the graph
  structure not.
- Enable `StableGraph` by default
- Add method `Graph::contains_edge`.
- Renamed `EdgeDirection` → `Direction`.
- Remove `SubTopo`.
- Require Rust 1.12 or later

  for greater confidence in its correctness.

## [0.2.3] - 2016-02-22
