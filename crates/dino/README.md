# `petgraph-dino`

> Who doesn't want to have a pet dinosaur?

This crate exposes an example implementation of a graph data structure using the `GraphStorage` trait from
the `petgraph-core` crate. It is intended to be used as a reference implementation for the `GraphStorage` trait, and as
a playground for testing various crates.
