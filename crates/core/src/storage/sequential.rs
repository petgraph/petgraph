///
/// The index mapper is a type, that maps a specific value (`From`), typically a [`LinearGraphId`],
/// into a different value ([`usize`]).
///
/// Mapping is bijective, meaning that `From -> usize` and `usize -> From` are both possible, and
/// that every `From` value has a unique `usize` value in the range specified by `0..Self::MAX`.
/// Meaning it is not possible to have a mapping of e.g. three nodes, like: `A`, `B`, `C` to `1`,
/// `3`, `5` with `MAX = 5`, because `2` and `4` are not mapped to anything.
///
/// How this conversion is done is up to the implementation, but should be consistent, i.e. the same
/// input value should always map to the same output value.
/// Index lookup should also be (if possible) `O(1)` for `Id -> usize`, but not necessarily for
/// `usize -> Id`.
