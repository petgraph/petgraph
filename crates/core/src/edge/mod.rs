//! # Edges
//!
//! This module contains the three edge types used by the graph, an edge is a connection between two
//! nodes, that may or may not be directed and has a weight.
//!
//! The three edge types are:
//! * [`Edge`]: An immutable edge, that borrows the graph.
//! * [`EdgeMut`]: A mutable edge, that borrows the graph.
//! * [`DetachedEdge`]: An edge that is not attached to the graph.
//!
//! In application code [`DetachedEdge`]s can easily be interchanged with [`Edge`]s and vice-versa,
//! as long as all components are [`Clone`]able.
//!
//! You should prefer to use [`Edge`]s and [`EdgeMut`]s over [`DetachedEdge`]s, as they are more
//! efficient, as these are simply (mutable) reference into the underlying graph (storage).
//!
//! [`EdgeMut`]s are only needed when you want to mutate the weight of an edge, otherwise you should
//! use [`Edge`]s.
