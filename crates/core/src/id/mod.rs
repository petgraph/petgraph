//! Module for identifiers.
//!
//! Identifiers are used to _identify_ edges and nodes.
//!
//! Primarily this module defines one type: [`GraphId`], which should not be implemented alone, but
//! instead be implemented alongside [`ManagedGraphId`] and [`ArbitraryGraphId`], which are mutually
//! exclusive and define if a node or edge id will be automatically assigned by the graph (are
//! managed) and a user has no control over their value or are arbitrary, allowing the user to use
//! _any_ value.

// Another possibility would've been to use `Hash` for `GraphId`, but `ArbitaryGraphId` needs to be
// a wrapper type anyway, so it could just require `Hash` for the inner type, and then implement
// `PartialEq` based on that.
