//! # Shortest Path Module
//!
//! This module contains traits and implementations for shortest path and shortest distance
//! algorithms.
//! These algorithms are used to find the shortest path or distance between two nodes in a graph.
//!
//! ## Traits
//!
//! - [`ShortestPath`]: Any implementation of this trait can be used to find the shortest path,
//!   depending on algorithm some restrictions may apply.
//! - [`ShortestDistance`]: Any implementation of this trait can be used to find the shortest
//!   distance, depending on algorithm some restrictions may apply.
//!
//! ## Implementations
//!
//! These are the algorithms implemented in `petgraph` itself, companion crates may implement other
//! algorithms.
//!
//! - [`AStar`]: An implementation of the A* shortest path algorithm.
//! - [`BellmanFord`]: An implementation of the Bellman-Ford shortest path algorithm.
//! - [`Dijkstra`]: An implementation of the Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm.
//! - [`FloydWarshall`]: An implementation of the Floyd-Warshall shortest path algorithm.
//!
//! ## Usage
//!
//! Each algorithm provides methods to find the shortest path or distance from a source node to a
//! target node, from a source node to all other nodes, and between all pairs of nodes.
//!
//! The [`ShortestPath`] trait provides methods to find paths, while the [`ShortestDistance`] trait
//! provides methods to find distances.
//! The difference between a path and a distance is that a path includes the sequence of nodes and
//! edges, while a distance is just the sum of the weights of the edges.
//!
//! ## Example
//!
//! ```rust
//! use petgraph_algorithms::shortest_paths::{Dijkstra, ShortestPath};
//! use petgraph_dino::DiDinoGraph;
//!
//! let mut graph = DiDinoGraph::new();
//! let a = graph.insert_node("A").id();
//! let b = graph.insert_node("B").id();
//! graph.insert_edge(7, a, b);
//!
//! let dijkstra = Dijkstra::directed();
//! let path = dijkstra.path_between(&graph, a, b);
//! assert!(path.is_some());
//!
//! let path = dijkstra.path_between(&graph, b, a);
//! assert!(path.is_none());
//! ```

/// # Shortest Path
///
/// A shortest path algorithm is an algorithm that finds a path between two nodes in a graph such
/// that the sum of the weights of its constituent edges is minimized.
///
/// Different algorithms exist to solve this problem, each with its own trade-offs, refer to the
/// different algorithms for more information.
///
/// ## Shortest Path vs Shortest Distance
///
/// The shortest path is the path between two nodes that has the lowest cost.
/// The shortest distance is the cost of the shortest path.
/// You should prefer shortest distance algorithms over shortest path algorithms if you are only
/// interested in the cost of the shortest path.
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```rust
/// use petgraph_algorithms::shortest_paths::{Dijkstra, ShortestPath};
/// use petgraph_dino::DiDinoGraph;
///
/// let mut graph = DiDinoGraph::new();
/// let a = graph.insert_node("A").id();
/// let b = graph.insert_node("B").id();
/// let c = graph.insert_node("C").id();
///
/// graph.insert_edge(7, a, b);
/// graph.insert_edge(5, b, c);
/// graph.insert_edge(3, a, c);
///
/// let dijkstra = Dijkstra::directed();
/// let path = dijkstra.path_between(&graph, a, c).expect("path exists");
///
/// assert_eq!(path.cost().into_value(), 3);
///
/// assert_eq!(path.path().source().id(), a);
/// assert_eq!(path.path().target().id(), c);
